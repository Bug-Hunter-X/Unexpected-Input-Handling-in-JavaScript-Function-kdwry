This repository demonstrates an example of unexpected input handling in JavaScript functions. The `foo` function handles null values gracefully, returning 0 if either `a` or `b` is null. However, it doesn't explicitly handle undefined values or non-numeric input.  The `bug.js` file contains the initial code with this limitation.  The solution in `bugSolution.js` improves the robustness of the function by adding checks for undefined and non-numeric input.
